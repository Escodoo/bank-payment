This module introduces an option to restrict Payment Orders to a single partner.  
To enable this feature:

1. Go to **Invoicing > Configuration > Payment Modes**.
2. In the desired Payment Mode, activate the checkbox **Individual Payment**.

When this option is enabled, all move lines in a Payment Order must belong to the same partner. Any attempt to add lines from a different partner will result in a validation error.
